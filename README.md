compute the average of final grades;
projects and mid terms determ final grade
begin 
total average of grade = 90
if score 90 or above 
    grade is an A
  else 
      if the score is 80 or above 
        grade is a B 
       else 
        if the grade is a 70 or more 
          grade is C 
          score = raw input ("#enter score") 
Conduct an algorithm to calculate final grade.
